# Rails Ideas App

This ideas app is Amina's first attempt at building something using Rails. She created this at a Rails Girls London Workshop on 1 December. [Here](http://guides.railsgirls.com/app) is the tutorial used.

In order to spin up this project, use the terminal to locate yourself in the railsgirls directory `cd railsgirls`

You can then start the rails server by running `rails server`

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser and you should be able to see the project!
